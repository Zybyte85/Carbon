# Contributing to Carbon
Thank you for taking interest in contributing to Carbon. There are a lot of things you can do to help, even if you aren't a programmer. Here are some of the things:
- Make art for icons
- Add/fix something on the issues, or on the planned features list in the README.
- Just use it! It would make me happy and you could give suggestions/bug reports

Just remember that carbon is still in a very early, and not very usuable state right now. But YOU could help change that :)
